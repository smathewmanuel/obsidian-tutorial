## Links
- Links are created using double square brackets like so `[[]]` 
- Add `#` after the links to reference to certain headings.
```
[[Name-Of-The-Note#Heading]]
```
- If you want contents of a heading shown in the notes, add a `!` before the links.
```
![[Name-Of-The-Note#Heading]]
```
- To reference paragraphs, use `^` and select the paragraph.
```
![[Name-Of-The-Note#^687d8b]
```
## Tags
-  `#` could be used to generate hashtags for searchability.
- Hashtags should be made useful like `#Obsidian/Tutorial`
## Content
- Obsidian uses markdown formatting. So anything that works in a `*.md` file works here too.
- Copy and paste images as usual with `Ctrl + C` and `Ctrl + V`.
- `>`  to add quotes
> Something in the quotes don't make sense. - Alby Weinstein
- Tasks can be achieved using `[ ]` Eg. 
	- [ ] A sample task
- More than one line can be selected using `Alt` key.
